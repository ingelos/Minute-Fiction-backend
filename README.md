## Minute Fiction backend
Minute Fiction was developed as assignment for the Backend module of the Novi Hogeschool bootcamp Full Stack Developer.
It's an application for authors and readers of fiction. 

Authors can register and create an Author profile, with which they can submit stories to open themes. 
These themes and submitted stories are managed by the Editor(s), who can also publish accepted stories.
Readers can leave comments on stories. The editor can send a mailing to all subscribed accountholders.

Stories are under a 100 words, therefore readable in under a minute. 
Hence the name Minute Fiction, as minute stands for both a period of time equal to sixty seconds and for extremely small.
